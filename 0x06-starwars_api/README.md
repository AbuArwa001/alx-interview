# Star Wars API Project

This project requires you to interact with the Star Wars API to fetch and display information about Star Wars characters based on the movie ID provided as an argument.

## Concepts Needed

### HTTP Requests in JavaScript
- Understand how to make HTTP requests to external services using the `request` module or alternatives like `fetch` in Node.js.
- Resources:
  - [A Complete Guide to Making HTTP Requests in Node.js](https://nodejs.dev/learn/making-http-requests-with-nodejs)

### Working with APIs
- Understand the basics of RESTful APIs and how to interact with them.
- Parsing JSON data returned by APIs.
- Resources:
  - [Working with APIs in JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Client-side_web_APIs/Introduction)

### Asynchronous Programming
- Manage asynchronous operations with callbacks, promises, and async/await syntax.
- Handle API response data asynchronously.
- Resources:
  - [Asynchronous Programming in JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Asynchronous)

### Command Line Arguments in Node.js
- Use the `process.argv` array to access command-line arguments passed to a Node.js script.
- Resources:
  - [How to Parse Command Line Arguments in Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/knowledge/command-line/how-to-parse-command-line-arguments/)

### Array Manipulation and Iteration
- Iterate over arrays and manipulate data structures to format and display character names.
- Resources:
  - [JavaScript Array Methods](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array)
